# Electric Vehicle Market Analysis for India - AtliQ Motors

##  Project Overview:

This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market in India to help AtliQ Motors, a major EV player in North America, strategically expand its presence in India. With a market share of less than 2% in India compared to 25% in North America, this analysis aims to identify key insights, trends, and actionable recommendations for the companyâ€™s growth.<br><br>
I analyzed EV sales data from various states across fiscal years 2022 to 2024, focusing on sales, penetration rates, and regional market dynamics. Using advanced data analysis techniques, I conducted detailed research on customer preferences, government incentives, market growth, and future projections for both 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers.

- **Top 10 States by EV Sales CAGR:** Meghalaya, Goa, and Karnataka emerged as the fastest-growing states, with respective CAGRs of 28.47%, 27.41%, and 25.28% in total vehicle sales.
- **Peak and Low Season Sales:** March consistently showed peak EV sales across fiscal years, with low sales observed in May for FY 2022 and FY 2023.
- **Revenue Growth:** The revenue from 4-wheelers showed a 367.79% growth from 2022 to 2024, compared to a 269.28% growth for 2-wheelers.
- **Customer Preferences for 4-Wheelers:** In 2023 and 2024, the primary reasons for customers choosing 4-wheelers included cost savings, government incentives, environmental concerns, and improved charging infrastructure.
- **Government Subsidies:** States like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Meghalaya offered substantial EV subsidies, significantly impacting the adoption rates of 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers.

## Conclusion:

The EV market in India is poised for rapid growth, particularly in urban centers and states offering strong government incentives. AtliQ Motors can capitalize on this trend by focusing on high-potential states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, while addressing infrastructure challenges and customer needs for both 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers.
